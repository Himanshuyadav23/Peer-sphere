# 🎯 YOU ARE HERE - Action Required!

I can't automatically log you in to EAS (it requires your credentials), but I've set up **EVERYTHING ELSE** for you!

## ✅ What I Did (Automatic)

✅ Created git tag `v1.0.0`  
✅ Pushed tag to GitHub  
✅ Updated app.json with proper config  
✅ Created ALL documentation  
✅ Setup scripts ready  
✅ EAS CLI installed  

## 🎯 What YOU Need To Do (Just 3 Commands!)

Run these 3 commands in your terminal:

### 1. Login to EAS (First Time Only)
```bash
cd PeerSphereMobile
eas login
```
**Enter your Expo credentials when prompted**

### 2. Build the APK
```bash
eas build:configure
eas build --platform android --profile preview
```

### 3. Upload to GitHub
After build completes:
- Download APK from https://expo.dev/builds
- Go to: https://github.com/Himanshuyadav23/Peer-sphere/releases/new
- Upload APK
- Publish!

## 🚀 Quick Start

I prepared 3 simple files for you:

1. **COMPLETE_SETUP_INSTRUCTIONS.md** - Step-by-step what to do
2. **CREATE_RELEASE_NOW.md** - Visual guide to GitHub release
3. **START_HERE.md** - Navigation guide

## ⏱️ Time Estimate

**Total time:** ~45 minutes  
**Active time:** ~8 minutes (most is waiting for build)

**You literally just need to:**
1. Run `eas login` → Type credentials → Enter
2. Run `eas build` → Wait 30 min → Download
3. Upload to GitHub → Click publish → Done!

---

## 🆘 Stuck?

**"Where do I type these commands?"**
→ Open PowerShell in your project folder

**"What's my Expo password?"**
→ Sign up at expo.dev if you don't have one

**"Which file do I read?"**
→ Start with: COMPLETE_SETUP_INSTRUCTIONS.md

**"Can't you do it for me?"**
→ I need your Expo account to login (can't auto-type passwords)

---

## 💡 Pro Tip

Once you're logged in, you can run:
```bash
.\build_and_release.ps1
```

And it will handle everything! But you need to login first.

**Ready? Open PowerShell and type:** `eas login` 🚀
