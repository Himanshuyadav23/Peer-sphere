# Peer Sphere

A social platform for SCSIT DAVV students to connect, collaborate, and build communities.

## Platforms

- üåê **Web App**: Next.js-based web application
- üì± **Mobile App**: React Native mobile application (iOS & Android)

Both platforms share the same Firebase backend, allowing users to access their data seamlessly across devices.

## Web App Setup

### 1. Environment Variables

Create a `.env.local` file in the root directory with your Firebase configuration:

```env
NEXT_PUBLIC_FIREBASE_API_KEY=your_api_key_here
NEXT_PUBLIC_FIREBASE_AUTH_DOMAIN=your_project_id.firebaseapp.com
NEXT_PUBLIC_FIREBASE_PROJECT_ID=your_project_id
NEXT_PUBLIC_FIREBASE_STORAGE_BUCKET=your_project_id.appspot.com
NEXT_PUBLIC_FIREBASE_MESSAGING_SENDER_ID=your_sender_id
NEXT_PUBLIC_FIREBASE_APP_ID=your_app_id
```

You can get these values from your Firebase project settings.

### 2. Install Dependencies

```bash
npm install
```

### 3. Run Development Server

```bash
npm run dev
```

Open [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000) with your browser to see the result.

## Mobile App Setup

The mobile app is located in the `PeerSphereMobile/` directory. See [PeerSphereMobile/README.md](./PeerSphereMobile/README.md) for detailed setup instructions.

### Quick Start

```bash
cd PeerSphereMobile
npm install
```

Configure Firebase in `lib/firebase.ts` using the same credentials as the web app.

Run the app:
```bash
npm start
# Press 'i' for iOS, 'a' for Android, or scan QR code with Expo Go app
```

## Shared Database

Both the web and mobile apps use the same Firebase backend:
- **Firebase Authentication**: Same user accounts across platforms
- **Cloud Firestore**: Shared communities, events, and messages
- **Real-time Sync**: Changes on one platform reflect on the other
